<!-- Writing a template -->
<!-- Template defines what the page should look like, and django fills in the relevant data each time the page is requested. A template allows you to access any data provided by the view. Because our view for the home page provided no data, this template is fairly simple -->

<!-- Inside the learning_logs folder, make a new folder called templates. Inside
the templates folder, make another folder called learning_logs. This might seem
a little redundant (we have a folder named learning_logs inside a folder named
templates inside a folder named learning_logs), but it sets up a structure that
Django can interpret unambiguously, even in the context of a large project
containing many individual apps. -->


<!-- Django
will take the requested URL, and that URL will match the pattern ''; then
Django will call the function views.index(), which will render the page using
the template contained in index.html. -->

<!-- The child template -->
<!-- Now we need to rewrite index.html to inherit from base.html -->

<!-- A child template must have an % extends % tag on the first
line to tell Django which parent template to inherit from. The file base.html
is part of learning_logs, so we include learning_logs in the path to the parent
template. This line pulls in everything contained in the base.html template
and allows index.html to define what goes in the space reserved by the
content block. -->
{% extends "learningLogs/base.html" %}

<!-- We define the content block below by inserting a % block % tag with
the name content. Everything that we aren’t inheriting from the parent template
goes inside the content block -->
{% block content %}

<p>Learning Log helps you keep track of your learning, for any topic you're learning about.</p>

<!-- We indicate that we’re finished defining the content by using an 
% endblock content % tag. The % endblock % tag doesn’t require a name, 
but if a template grows to contain multiple blocks, it can be helpful to 
know exactly which block is ending. -->
{% endblock content %}
