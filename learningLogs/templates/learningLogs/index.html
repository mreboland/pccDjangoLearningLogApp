<!-- Writing a template -->
<!-- Template defines what the page should look like, and django fills in the relevant data each time the page is requested. A template allows you to access any data provided by the view. Because our view for the home page provided no data, this template is fairly simple -->

<!-- Inside the learning_logs folder, make a new folder called templates. Inside
the templates folder, make another folder called learning_logs. This might seem
a little redundant (we have a folder named learning_logs inside a folder named
templates inside a folder named learning_logs), but it sets up a structure that
Django can interpret unambiguously, even in the context of a large project
containing many individual apps. -->


<!-- Django
will take the requested URL, and that URL will match the pattern ''; then
Django will call the function views.index(), which will render the page using
the template contained in index.html. -->
